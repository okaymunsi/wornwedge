Steps to setup Jekyll
---------------------

Setting up nginx
----------------
1. Get Nginx
        sudo apt install nginx

2. Check that nginx is running
        sudo systemctl status nginx

        if not running, to start:
        sudo systemctl start nginx

        to stop:
        sudo systemctl stop nginx

        to enable on startup:
        sudo systemctl enable nginx

3. Allow traffic through firewall
        sudo ufw app list

        confirm Nginx is on there (of various forms)

        sudo ufw allow '<Entry from List>'

        Check status:
        sudo ufw status

4. Websites go here : /var/www/<make_a_dir_in_here>/<all_my_html_files_go_here>
   Nginx available sites go here : /etc/nginx/sites-available/example.com
   Nginx active sites go here : /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/example.com

	Wise to..
	softlink the website form the sites-available to sites-enabled
	that way, you can make changes to sites-available and it immediately
	gets reflected in sites-enabled, AND if you want to disable website
	just delete the softlink in the sites-enabled. Done!

	> ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/wornwedge.com /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/

5. To restart and apply changes :
   sudo systemctl restart nginx
