Steps to setup Jekyll
---------------------

Setting up nginx
----------------
1. Get Nginx
        sudo apt install nginx

2. Check that nginx is running
        sudo systemctl status nginx

        if not running, to start:
        sudo systemctl start nginx

        to stop:
        sudo systemctl stop nginx

        to enable on startup:
        sudo systemctl enable nginx

3. Allow traffic through firewall
        sudo ufw app list

        confirm Nginx is on there (of various forms)

        sudo ufw allow '<Entry from List>'

        Check status:
        sudo ufw status

	* NOTE: By default when setting up server, it will..
		deny all incoming traffic
		allow all outgoing traffic

		so, by default, ssh will not be supported on default port 22

	So, run..
		sudo ufw allow ssh
		and check with..
		sudo ufw status verbose

4. Websites go here : /var/www/<make_a_dir_in_here>/<all_my_html_files_go_here>
   Nginx available sites go here : /etc/nginx/sites-available/example.com
   Nginx active sites go here : /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/example.com

	Wise to..
	softlink the website form the sites-available to sites-enabled
	that way, you can make changes to sites-available and it immediately
	gets reflected in sites-enabled, AND if you want to disable website
	just delete the softlink in the sites-enabled. Done!

	> ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/wornwedge.com /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/

5. To restart and apply changes :
   sudo systemctl restart nginx
